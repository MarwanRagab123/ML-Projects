# Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM

## Project Overview
This project implements a binary classification system to distinguish between cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system processes images and classifies them into either cat or dog categories.

## Features
- Binary image classification
- SVM implementation
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Image preprocessing:
  - Resizing
  - Normalization
  - Feature extraction
- Cross-validation
- Performance metrics calculation

### Tools Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Project Structure
- `cat-or-dog-using-svm.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and analysis

## Requirements
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
opencv-python
jupyter
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook cat-or-dog-using-svm.ipynb
```

## Results
- Binary classification accuracy
