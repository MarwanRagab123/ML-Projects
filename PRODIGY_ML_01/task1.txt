Task 1 Documentation
====================

Date: 2025-05-06

Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook (problem1_intern_Prodigy_.ipynb)
- Python 3 kernel
- Pandas (pd)
- NumPy (np)
- Matplotlib (plt)
- Seaborn (sns)
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, metrics, model_selection, preprocessing)
- File inspection tools

Approach:
1. Data loading with pandas (train.csv, test.csv)
2. Data exploration using train_df.head()
3. Machine learning with scikit-learn
4. Examined notebook metadata to understand environment
5. Verified Python 3 kernel specification
6. Checked notebook structure

Results:
- Notebook uses standard Jupyter format (nbformat 4)
- Configured for Python 3 execution
- Achieved R2 Score: 0.7266 (72.66% variance explained)
- RMSLE: 0.2422 (Root Mean Squared Log Error)
- These metrics indicate a moderately strong model performance
- Using regression models (Linear, Polynomial)
- Includes evaluation metrics (MSE, R2, MSLE)

Observations:
- Actual code cells not yet inspected
- Need to examine cell contents for complete analysis

Next Steps:
1. Review notebook code cells
2. Execute cells to verify functionality
3. Document any errors or outputs
